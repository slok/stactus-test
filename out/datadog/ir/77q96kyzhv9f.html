<p>At this time, newly ingested data is properly queryable, and monitors targeting Logs sent from 2023-10-03 20:40 UTC onwards are valid.</p>

<p>Queries targeting logs between 2023-10-02 11:40 UTC and 2023-10-03 20:40 UTC may return erroneous data.  We are evaluating a fix that will restore query correctness for this time-window.</p>
