            <p>
                <p>We recently encountered an issue where newly-created Grafana Cloud API keys were not authenticating correctly with backend gateway services (e.g., Mimir, Loki, Tempo). This was due to a change implemented late last week. A hotfix has been applied and this issue is fully resolved.</p>
