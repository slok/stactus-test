            <h3> Resolved - Sep  9, 22:59 </h3>
            <p> <p>From 17:04 UTC to 21:43 UTC, users may not have seen the option to resize an attached Block Storage Volume via the Cloud Control Panel, or may have encountered errors when attempting to resize attached Volumes via the API.</p>

<p>Our Engineering team has confirmed the resolution of the issue and Volume resizes should now be functioning normally in all regions.</p>

<p>If you continue to experience problems, please open a ticket with our support team. We apologize for any inconvenience.</p>
