            <h3> Resolved - Jun 12, 16:41 </h3>
            <p> <p>From 13:45 - 16:04 UTC, users were unable to sign up for new DigitalOcean accounts at <a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com" target="_blank">https://cloud.digitalocean.com</a> and existing users were unable to update credit card information within the Cloud Control Panel, due to an issue with a billing verification key. This issue is now fully resolved and users should be able to interact with the Cloud Control Panel normally.</p>

<p>We apologize for the inconvenience and invite users to retry any failed attempts. If you continue to experience issues or have any questions, please reach out to Support from within your account.</p>
