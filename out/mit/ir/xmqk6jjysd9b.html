            <h3> Update - Mar 21, 12:08 </h3>
            <p> <p>MIT suffered a failure of its connectivity to the external Internet, which resulted in members of the MIT community being unable to connect to external platforms and services (Zoom, Dropbox, Google, Amazon, etc.) beginning at approximately 10:40am this morning. This connectivity failure was the result of an issue with the configuration to MIT&rsquo;s external internet providers, and was corrected at approximately 11:20am, at which time all connectivity and services were fully restored. We are reviewing the issue and our overall configuration with our external connectivity and internet providers, working to put additional measures in place to protect against any such issues in the future.</p>
