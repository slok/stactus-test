            <h3> Resolved - Aug 14, 21:41 </h3>
            <p> <p>Our Engineering team has resolved the issue where some customers have not been receiving payment receipts. To mitigate this issue in the future, we recommend customers take the following actions:</p>

<p>Check your junk/spam folders. If you find the email there, mark it as &ldquo;not spam&rdquo;. You can also save HashiCorp&rsquo;s email address, invoice+statements@cloud.hashicorp.com, to your contacts to prevent future occurrences.</p>

<p>Check for third-party filtering. If you use a corporate or business email address, your IT department may be using third-party services that are blocking the message. Your company&rsquo;s IT department or mail provider can confirm this. If so, they may need to specifically allow @cloud.hashicorp.com and @hashicorp.com to prevent future occurrences.</p>

<p>These systems should be operating normally. If you continue to experience any problems, please open a ticket with our support team.</p>
