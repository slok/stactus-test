                <p>Our Engineering team has fully resolved the issue causing errors for secret writes and increased latency for secret reads in HCP Vault Secrets. The issue was related to the AWS CloudWatch log service degradation which has been resolved as well.</p>

<p>HCP Vault Secrets should now be operating normally. If you continue to experience any problems, please open a ticket with our support team.</p>

            <p>
                <p>Our Engineering team has resolved the issue where some customers have not been receiving payment receipts. To mitigate this issue in the future, we recommend customers take the following actions:</p>

<p>Check your junk/spam folders. If you find the email there, mark it as &ldquo;not spam&rdquo;. You can also save HashiCorp&rsquo;s email address, invoice+statements@cloud.hashicorp.com, to your contacts to prevent future occurrences.</p>

<p>Check for third-party filtering. If you use a corporate or business email address, your IT department may be using third-party services that are blocking the message. Your company&rsquo;s IT department or mail provider can confirm this. If so, they may need to specifically allow @cloud.hashicorp.com and @hashicorp.com to prevent future occurrences.</p>

<p>These systems should be operating normally. If you continue to experience any problems, please open a ticket with our support team.</p>
