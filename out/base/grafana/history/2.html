                <p>Starting at ~21:11 UTC, Loki had a brief outage. Users may have experienced degraded write path performance for approximately 10 minutes, and 2-3 minutes of total write and read outage. This has since been resolved.</p>

                <p>The incident is fully resolved now, root cause was determined and mitigated. The particular cell affected had a legacy config present, which caused a panic during the regular rollout. The cell was rolled back as a precaution and the mentioned config is now corrected.</p>

            <p>
                <p>Between 10:45 UTC and 11:05 UTC we experienced an outage with scripted and multi-http test executions across all public probe locations.  These two check types were not executing tests, so you may see gaps in the synthetics metrics and logs in that window.   Protocol-level test executions (ping, dns, tcp, http, traceroute) were unaffected.  As of 11:05 UTC the incident is resolved and all check types are executing normally.</p>
