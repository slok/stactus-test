            <h3> Update - Apr 28, 23:46 </h3>
            <p> <p>We have released a fix for the metrics display problem. Affected metrics displays should have returned to a functioning state. We are still actively engaged with our vendor and are working with their engineering team on fixing the root cause of this issue.</p>

            <h3> Update - Apr 28, 02:50 </h3>
            <p> <p>We are still actively engaged with our vendor while their engineering teams work on the issue. Unfortunately, alternative workarounds did not produce acceptable results. Once again, this is purely a display problem and we are not experiencing any data loss.</p>
