            <p> <p>Earlier this month, several hundred Atlassian customers were impacted by a site outage. We have published a Post-Incident Review which includes a technical deep dive on what happened, details on how we restored customers sites, and the immediate actions we’ve taken to improve our operations and approach to incident management.</p>

With automation in full effect, we have  significantly increased the pace at which we are conducting technical restoration of affected customer sites, and we have reduced the time required for the validation of restored sites by half.

            <p> <p>We have now restored functionality for 53% of users impacted by the outage.</p>

<p>As outlined in yesterday’s update, we are restoring affected customers using a three step process:</p>

<ol>
<li>Technical restoration of affected sites</li>
<li>Internal validation of restored sites</li>
<li>Validating with affected customers before enabling their users</li>
</ol>

<p>By automating some of our validation steps, we have now reduced time for internal validation of restored sites by half, which allows our support engineers to more quickly engage restored customers for validation and full site handover.</p>

            <p> <p>We have restored functionality for 49% of users impacted by the outage. We are taking a batch-based approach to restoring customers, and to-date, this process has been semi-automated. We are beginning to shift towards a more automated process to restore sites. That said, there are still a number of steps required before we hand a site to customers for review and acceptance. We are restoring affected customers identified by a mix of multiple variables including site size, complexity, edition, tenure, and several other factors in groups of up to 60 at a time. The full restoration process involves our engineering teams, our customer support teams, and our customer, and has three steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Technical restoration involving meta-data recovery, data restores across a number of services, and ensuring the data across the different systems is working correctly for product and ecosystem apps</li>
<li>Verification of site functionality to ensure the technical restoration has worked as expected</li>
<li>Lastly, working directly with the affected customer to enable them to verify their data and functionality before enabling for their users
We have also contacted all customers who are <em>up next</em> for step 3 in the site restoration process described above. These customers are aware that they are next in queue through their support ticket and/or via a support engineer.
We have proactively reached out to technical contacts and system admins at all impacted customers, and opened support tickets for each of them. However, we learned that some customers have not yet heard from us or engaged with our support team.
