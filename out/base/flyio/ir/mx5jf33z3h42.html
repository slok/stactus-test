            <h3> Resolved - Jun 27, 23:22 </h3>
            <p> <p>This incident has been resolved.</p>

<p>Some of our edges received incorrect state data for a small number of apps that used the bluegreen deploy strategy. This resulted in 502 errors when attempting to reach those apps. We identified approximately 36 apps that were impacted, including the Fly.io homepage and dashboard.</p>

            <h3> Update - Jun 27, 21:50 </h3>
            <p> <p>A small number of customer apps may still be seeing 502 errors due to stale state information. We are working to address this. For any apps still experiencing the error, re-deploying with <code>fly deploy</code> will correct the state information and resolve the errors.</p>
