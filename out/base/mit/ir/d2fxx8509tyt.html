            <h3> Investigating - Dec  4, 21:54 </h3>
            <p> <p>To: All Data Warehouse users,</p>

<p>This is a notification that some of the data we receive from SAP has not been refreshed since the SAP Support Pack Upgrade that occurred this weekend. During the scheduled maintenance outage, SAP’s Year-End Support Packages were installed, bringing MIT’s SAP implementation up to the support package level required for annual Accounts Payable and HR/Payroll system compliance, however there were changes made that impacted the extract process.</p>

<p>The data that has been impacted includes, but may not be limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Financial data – cost objects, fund centers, project wbs, etc</li>
<li>Roles data</li>
<li>Payroll</li>
<li>SAP Lookups / additional master data</li>
<li>Purchasing / change log</li>
<li>Balances / Budgets</li>
</ul>

<p>The SAP teams are working to resolve this issue.</p>

<p>Please visit <a href="http://3down.mit.edu/" target="_blank">http://3down.mit.edu/</a> for updates during the outage. If you have any questions about this system outage or the maintenance being performed, please feel free to contact Kevin Lyons at klyons@mit.edu</p>

<p>Thank you for your patience and understanding during this scheduled system maintenance.</p>
