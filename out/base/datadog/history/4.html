                <p>We have finished backfilling data across all products: all data received during the incident that had been successfully buffered but unprocessed, is now fully accessible on the platform. Due to the nature of this outage, you may see some residual gaps in the data we received within the first few hours after the start of the incident.</p>

<p>We truly appreciate your patience and understanding during this incident.</p>
