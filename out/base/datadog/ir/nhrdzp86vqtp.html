            <h3> Update - Mar  8, 15:39 </h3>
            <p> <p>At 06:00 UTC on March 8th, 2023 the Datadog platform started experiencing widespread issues across multiple products and regions . The web application was unavailable or intermittently loading, and data ingestion &amp; monitor evaluation were delayed.</p>

<p>We will share a more detailed analysis post-recovery, but at a very high level:
A system update on a number of hosts controlling our compute clusters caused a subset of these hosts to lose network connectivity
As a result a number of the corresponding clusters entered unhealthy states and caused failures in a number of the internal services, datastores and applications hosted on these clusters.</p>

<p>Our current status is:
We identified and mitigated the initial issue, and rebuilt our clusters
We also have recovered a number of our applications and services, including our web portals
We are now working on recovering and catching-up the rest of our data systems for metrics, traces and logs across the regions that are still affected (see region-specific status pages). The recovery work is currently constrained by the number and large scale of the systems involved.</p>

<p>What to expect next:
We are focusing on bringing back live data for all customers and all products before catching-up on any historical data we may have stored during the outage
We expect live data recovery in a matter of hours (not minutes, and not days)
We will continue to issue regular updates as the situation unfolds</p>

<p>We understand how critical Datadog is to your business, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and we are working hard to resolve this issue.</p>
