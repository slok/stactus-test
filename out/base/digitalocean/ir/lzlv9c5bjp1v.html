            <h3> Resolved - Jun 11, 09:59 </h3>
            <p> <p>Our Engineering team has identified and resolved an issue that impacted the Load Balancers associated with Kubernetes Clusters for a brief duration.</p>

<p>From 05:25 - 07:54 UTC, a subset of users may have experienced issues with accessing and connecting to Load Balancers associated with Kubernetes Clusters and may have noticed failed health checks for the Load Balancers.</p>

<p>Also from 7:50 - 8:40 UTC, our Engineering team observed an issue with the App Platform. A subset of users may have faced issues with connecting to outbound dependencies from the App platform.</p>

<p>Swift action was taken by our Engineering team that restored service and all services are operating correctly.</p>

<p>We apologize for the inconvenience. If you have any questions or continue to experience issues, please reach out via a Support ticket on your account.</p>
