            <h3> Resolved - Jun 17, 19:37 </h3>
            <p> <p>From 17:02 - 18:44 UTC, the Spaces API experienced availability dips. These dips caused Spaces bucket operations in SGP1 for a subset of users to experience latency or 503 errors.</p>

<p>The fix implemented by our Engineering team has been monitored and availability for the Spaces API is stable. Users should be able to interact with their Spaces buckets successfully.</p>

<p>If you continue to experience any issues, please reach out to the Support team from within your account.</p>
