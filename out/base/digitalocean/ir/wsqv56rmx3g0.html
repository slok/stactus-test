            <h3> Resolved - Jul  3, 21:36 </h3>
            <p> <p>Our Engineering team identified and resolved an issue with creation of Snapshots and Backups in the NYC3 region.</p>

<p>From 20:11 UTC to 21:04 UTC, users may have experienced errors while taking Snapshots of Droplets in NYC3. Backup creation was also failing, however, Backups will be retried automatically.</p>

<p>Our Engineering team quickly identified the root cause of the incident to be related to capacity on internal storage clusters and were able to rebalance capacity, allowing creations to succeed.</p>

<p>We apologize for the disruption. If you continue to experience any issues, please open a Support ticket from within your account.</p>
