            <h3> Resolved - Sep 12, 23:12 </h3>
            <p> <p>We identified and resolved an issue with entity metadata which affected the visibility of some infrastructure entities in the New Relic UI. Data ingest and alert notifications were not impacted.</p>

<p>After resolving the issue, we initiated a re-indexing process which has completed for the US and EU region restoring visibility of affected entities.</p>

<p>Some customers in the US region may experience issues viewing entities related to infrastructure cloud integrations, on-host integrations, and Kubernetes. Data ingest and alert notifications remain unaffected.</p>
