            <p> <p>Some customers in the US region may be experiencing delayed data in queries, charts, and dashboards as well as delayed or missing alert notifications for related data.</p>

<p>We have identified an issue with Alerts in the US region that may cause false-positive alert notifications. To reduce noise, alert notifications are being temporarily suppressed for applicable customers. We are working to resolve the underlying issue and will re-enable alert notifications upon resolution.</p>
