            <h3> Resolved - May 30, 19:22 </h3>
            <p> <p>On May 30th, 2024, between 03:37 PM UTC and 05:14 PM UTC Copilot chat conversations on github.com saw degraded availability, where chat requests referencing files from a repository failed. This was due to an expired security certificate, which required communication to an internal service. Overall, the error rate was 40% on average. Other Copilot chat experiences were unaffected during this time.<br /><br />The incident was mitigated by rotating the certificate in question.<br /><br />To prevent future incidents, we are working to reduce our time to detect and have removed certificate-based dependencies between these internal systems in the process.<br /></p>
