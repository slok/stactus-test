            <h3> Resolved - Aug 29, 21:54 </h3>
            <p> <p>On August 29th, 2024, from 16:56 UTC to 21:42 UTC, we observed an elevated rate of traffic on our public edge, which triggered GitHubâ€™s rate limiting protections. This resulted in <0.1% of users being identified as false-positives, which they experienced as intermittent connection timeouts. At 20:59 UTC the engineering team improved the system to remediate the false-positive identification of user traffic, and return to normal traffic operations.</p>
