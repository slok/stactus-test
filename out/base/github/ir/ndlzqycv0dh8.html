            <h3> Resolved - Aug 12, 14:41 </h3>
            <p> <p>On August 12, 2024 from 13:39 to 14:28 UTC some users experienced an elevated rate of errors of up to 0.45% from the GitHub API. Less than 5% of webhooks interactions failed and less than 0.5% of Actions runs were delayed.<br /><br />This impact was caused by internal networking instances being insufficiently scaled.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by provisioning additional instances. We are working to enhance the sizing strategy for the relevant infrastructure to prevent similar issues and to also improve monitoring and processes to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.</p>
