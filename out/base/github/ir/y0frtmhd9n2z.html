            <h3> Resolved - Jun 27, 23:44 </h3>
            <p> <p>On June 27th, 2024, between 22:38 UTC and 23:44 UTC some Codespaces customers in the West US region were unable to create and/or resume their Codespaces. This was due to a configuration change that affected customers with a large number of Codespace secrets defined.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by reverting the change.<br /><br />We are working to improve monitoring and testing processes to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.</p>
