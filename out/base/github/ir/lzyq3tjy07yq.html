            <h3> Resolved - Jul 17, 18:13 </h3>
            <p> <p>On July 17th, 2024 between 17:56 and 18:13 UTC the Codespaces service was degraded and 5% of codespaces were failing to start after creation. After analyzing the failing codespaces, we realized that all of them had reached the 1 hour timeout allocated for starting. Further, we realized that the root cause of the timeouts was the <a href="https://status.githubapp.com/incidents/1886?viewTimeOption=UTC">larger incident earlier in the day due to updating githubâ€™s network hardware</a>.<br />We realized this incident was already mitigated by the mitigation of the earlier incident.<br />We are working to see if we can improve our incident response process to better understand the connection between incidents in the future and avoid unnecessary incident noise for customers.<br /></p>
