            <h3> Resolved - Aug 27, 23:26 </h3>
            <p> <p>On August 28th, 2024, starting at 20:43 UTC, some customers accessing GitHub from North America experienced degraded access to GitHub services. The error was intermittent and manifested as timeouts when requests tried to reach endpoints. This was due to a degraded route internal to one of our transit providers. We identified the unhealthy provider path and drained it at 23:26 UTC, rerouting traffic through other providers and promptly restoring normal traffic operations.</p>
