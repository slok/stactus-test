            <h3> Resolved - Aug 29, 01:43 </h3>
            <p> <p>On August 28, 2024, from 21:40 to 23:43 UTC, up to 25% of unauthenticated dotcom traffic in SE Asia (representing % of global traffic) encountered HTTP 500 errors. We observed elevated error rates at one of our global points of presence, where geo-DNS health checks were failing. We identified unhealthy cloud hardware in the region, indicated by abnormal CPU utilization patterns. As a result, we drained the site at 23:26 UTC, which promptly restored normal traffic operations.</p>
