            <h3> Resolved - Jul 30, 16:22 </h3>
            <p> <p>On July 30th, 2024, between 12:15 UTC and 14:22 UTC the Codespaces service was degraded in the UK South and West Europe regions. During this time, approximately 75% of attempts to create or resume Codespaces in these regions were failing.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by resolving networking stability issues in these regions.<br /><br />We are working to improve network resiliency to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.</p>

            <p> <p>We are starting to see recovery for this issue and are monitoring things closely. We will keep this incident open for now until we are fully confident on complete recovery.</p>

            <h3> Investigating - Jul 30, 16:09 </h3>
            <p> <p>We have correlated the impact on Codespaces to an outage with a third party service. We are continuing to investigate ways to reduce impact on our customers while we wait for that outage to be resolved.</p>
