            <h3> Resolved - Jun  6, 04:43 </h3>
            <p> <p>On June 6, 2024 between 03:29 and 04:19 UTC, the service responsible for the Maven package registry was degraded. This affected GitHub customers who were trying to upload packages to the Maven package registry.<br /><br />We observed increased database pressure due to bulk operations in progress, and at 04:19 UTC, the Maven upload issues resolved when those bulk operations finished. We&rsquo;re continuing to assess any additional compounding factors.<br /><br />We are working on improving our thresholds for existing alerts to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.<br /></p>
