            <h3> Update - Dec 14, 17:49 </h3>
            <p> <p>We are currently experiencing service degradation for Events API in our US environment (1password.com). Customers will not be able to see new signin events until service is restored. Some item usage events will be lost. This is also affecting some of our customers ability to download documents.</p>
