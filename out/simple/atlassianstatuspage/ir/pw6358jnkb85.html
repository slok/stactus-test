            <h4> Update </h4>
            <p>Earlier this month, several hundred Atlassian customers were impacted by a site outage. We have published a Post-Incident Review which includes a technical deep dive on what happened, details on how we restored customers sites, and the immediate actions we’ve taken to improve our operations and approach to incident management.</p>

            <p>We have now restored functionality for 53% of users impacted by the outage.</p>

<p>As outlined in yesterday’s update, we are restoring affected customers using a three step process:</p>

<ol>
<li>Technical restoration of affected sites</li>
<li>Internal validation of restored sites</li>
<li>Validating with affected customers before enabling their users</li>
</ol>

<p>By automating some of our validation steps, we have now reduced time for internal validation of restored sites by half, which allows our support engineers to more quickly engage restored customers for validation and full site handover.</p>

            <h4> Update </h4>
            <p>We have restored functionality for 49% of users impacted by the outage. We are taking a batch-based approach to restoring customers, and to-date, this process has been semi-automated. We are beginning to shift towards a more automated process to restore sites. That said, there are still a number of steps required before we hand a site to customers for review and acceptance. We are restoring affected customers identified by a mix of multiple variables including site size, complexity, edition, tenure, and several other factors in groups of up to 60 at a time. The full restoration process involves our engineering teams, our customer support teams, and our customer, and has three steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Technical restoration involving meta-data recovery, data restores across a number of services, and ensuring the data across the different systems is working correctly for product and ecosystem apps</li>
<li>Verification of site functionality to ensure the technical restoration has worked as expected</li>
<li>Lastly, working directly with the affected customer to enable them to verify their data and functionality before enabling for their users
We have also contacted all customers who are <em>up next</em> for step 3 in the site restoration process described above. These customers are aware that they are next in queue through their support ticket and/or via a support engineer.
We have proactively reached out to technical contacts and system admins at all impacted customers, and opened support tickets for each of them. However, we learned that some customers have not yet heard from us or engaged with our support team.

            <h4> Update </h4>
            <p>We have started successfully restoring sites and continue to work on restoration to a wider cohort of customers. We are taking a controlled and hands-on approach as we gather feedback from customers to ensure the integrity of this first round of restorations remains the same from our last update.</p>

            <p>We are beginning partial restoration to a cohort of customers. The early stages of this process will be controlled and hands-on, as we work with customers live to get feedback and ensure that restoration is working correctly before we accelerate the process for the next cohort. We will continue to post updates here as we move the process along.</p>

            <h4> Update </h4>
            <p>We have partially reactivated the Statuspages of affected customers. The hosted pages should be up, and the API capabilities have been restored so affected customers can use this to manage their pages while work is done to restore access to the manage portal. We have defined two processes to resolution of the issues impacting some customers. These processes each involve multiple stages of work. We are currently working on one of the processes and we will provide more detail as we progress through resolution.</p>
