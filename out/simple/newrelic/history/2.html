                <p>Between 15:23 UTC and 22:07 UTC on December 5th, some customers in the EU region may have experienced errors when sending data to New Relic, issues viewing real time data, and delayed or missing alert notifications related to real time data. To prevent our customers from receiving a high volume of false positive alert notifications, we temporarily suppressed notifications for affected data intermittently during this timeframe.</p>

<p>We have investigated and resolved this service interruption and impacted services have returned to normal operations.</p>
