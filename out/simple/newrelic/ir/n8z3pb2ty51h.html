            <h4> Resolved </h4>
            <p>Between 15:23 UTC and 22:07 UTC on December 5th, some customers in the EU region may have experienced errors when sending data to New Relic, issues viewing real time data, and delayed or missing alert notifications related to real time data. To prevent our customers from receiving a high volume of false positive alert notifications, we temporarily suppressed notifications for affected data intermittently during this timeframe.</p>

<p>We have investigated and resolved this service interruption and impacted services have returned to normal operations.</p>

            <h4> Update </h4>
            <p>Our teams are continuing to investigate issues with data ingest for multiple data types. Some customers in the EU region may experience intermittent errors when sending data to New Relic, issues viewing real time data, and delayed or missing alert notifications related to real time data.</p>

<p>We are seeing recovery of affected services at this time and have disabled alert notification suppression as a result. We&rsquo;re monitoring as services recover and will provide an additional update once we&rsquo;ve fully validated that all affected services have returned to normal operation.</p>
