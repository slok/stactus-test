            <h4> Resolved </h4>
            <p>Our Engineering team has fully resolved the issue causing errors for secret writes and increased latency for secret reads in HCP Vault Secrets. The issue was related to the AWS CloudWatch log service degradation which has been resolved as well.</p>

<p>HCP Vault Secrets should now be operating normally. If you continue to experience any problems, please open a ticket with our support team.</p>
