            <h4> Update </h4>
            <p>The third and final phase of this maintenance is now beginning. During this time, users may be unable to log into the HCP Portal and calls to HCP APIs may fail. This may impact the ability to create, modify, or delete clusters. Existing HCP Clusters will continue to operate normally.</p>

<p>We anticipate that all work will be complete within 3 hours. We will post another update once the maintenance has been completed.</p>
