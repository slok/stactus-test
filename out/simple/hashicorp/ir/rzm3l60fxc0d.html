            <h4> Update </h4>
            <p>We are continuing to monitor recovery, but we believe the impact to HashiCorp customers from this incident has concluded. We have deployed a workaround and will restore fully service once our cloud provider has recovered as well.</p>

<p>We are aware of a small number of projects (<20) that will need to be fixed before they are usable; we recommend creating a new project if you encounter any trouble with an existing project that was created during this incident as a workaround. Please contact your support team if you have any questions on how to do this.</p>

<p>We will post another update in approximately 12 hours, to wrap up our communications on this issue.</p>

            <h4> Update </h4>
            <p>We have deployed some workarounds and re-enabled new project creation. Some existing projects that were created during this incident may be affected, but we will be working to remediate those in the next day.</p>

<p>We are also continuing to monitor underlying cloud provider recovery and will restore workarounds to normal state once that occurs.</p>

            <p>While we continue to monitor the underlying cloud provider incident, we&rsquo;re also deploying some workarounds so that we can re-enable functionality like new project creation. We hope to report that we have workarounds in place and can consider the impact mitigated soon.</p>

            <h4> Update </h4>
            <p>We have confirmed that our project creation issues are related to an underlying cloud provider issue. At this time, we&rsquo;re keeping project creation disabled.</p>

<p>We also identified less than 20 projects affected during the course of this incident, up to our disabling of new project creation.</p>

<p>We will be investigating additional mitigation options and monitoring the situation, and you can expect additional regular updates or as needed updates if there&rsquo;s a status change.</p>
