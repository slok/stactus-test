            <h4> Resolved </h4>
            <p>We have finished backfilling data across all products: all data received during the incident that had been successfully buffered but unprocessed, is now fully accessible on the platform. Due to the nature of this outage, you may see some residual gaps in the data we received within the first few hours after the start of the incident.</p>

<p>We truly appreciate your patience and understanding during this incident.</p>

            <h4> Update </h4>
            <p>At 06:00 UTC on March 8th, 2023 the Datadog platform started experiencing widespread issues across multiple products and regions . The web application was unavailable or intermittently loading, and data ingestion &amp; monitor evaluation were delayed.</p>

<p>We will share a more detailed analysis post-recovery, but at a very high level:
A system update on a number of hosts controlling our compute clusters caused a subset of these hosts to lose network connectivity
As a result a number of the corresponding clusters entered unhealthy states and caused failures in a number of the internal services, datastores and applications hosted on these clusters.</p>

<p>Our current status is:
We identified and mitigated the initial issue, and rebuilt our clusters
We also have recovered a number of our applications and services, including our web portals
We are now working on recovering and catching-up the rest of our data systems for metrics, traces and logs across the regions that are still affected (see region-specific status pages). The recovery work is currently constrained by the number and large scale of the systems involved.</p>

<p>What to expect next:
We are focusing on bringing back live data for all customers and all products before catching-up on any historical data we may have stored during the outage
We expect live data recovery in a matter of hours (not minutes, and not days)
We will continue to issue regular updates as the situation unfolds</p>

<p>We understand how critical Datadog is to your business, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and we are working hard to resolve this issue.</p>
