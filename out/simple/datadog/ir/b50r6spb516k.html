            <p>The fix for the Monitors and Synthetics UIs is now deployed and we are in the process of re-enabling the search pages functionality. Monitor groups are being backfilled with a completion ETA of 90 minutes. Muted monitor state and monitor suggestions will remain out-of-date in search pages. This only affects the status reported in the UI.</p>
