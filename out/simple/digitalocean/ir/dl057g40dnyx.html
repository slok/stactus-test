            <h4> Investigating </h4>
            <p>Multiple Engineering teams are continuing to investigate errors with creating Droplets, other Droplet-based products, and events such as power/restore in the NYC3 region.</p>

<p>Users should no longer encounter errors when performing these operations, as mitigations are now in place, and teams have observed error rates returning to normal.</p>

<p>We apologize for the inconvenience and will share another update once we have more information.</p>
