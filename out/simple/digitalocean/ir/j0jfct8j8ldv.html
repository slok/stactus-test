            <h4> Investigating </h4>
            <p>As of 01:00 UTC, our Engineering team is currently investigating reports of an issue with our Droplet-based services in the NYC1 region.</p>

<p>At this time, users may experience issues reaching their Droplet via network requests and also see errors or stuck events when attempting Droplet actions such as power cycles, resizes, rebuilds, etc. Our team is working to mitigate the issue.</p>

<p>We realize how impacting this is and will provide an update as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience.</p>
