            <h4> Update </h4>
            <p>Our Engineering team has confirmed that the issue for Droplets with previously failed events has been remediated, and further events should now successfully complete.</p>

<p>We are continuing to monitor this situation and will post an update as soon as the issue is fully resolved.</p>

            <h4> Update </h4>
            <p>Our Engineering team has completed deployment of the fix. No additional users should now experience event failures.</p>

<p>Droplets that experienced failed events are now being remediated to fix their event state, so that future events can succeed normally.</p>

<p>We will provide another update once the remediation step is complete.</p>

            <h4> Update </h4>
            <p>Beginning around 16:00 UTC, our Engineering team identified an uptick in event errors for Droplets that utilize a Reserved IP in multiple regions. A subset of users are experiencing errors in processing events, especially &ldquo;power on&rdquo;, via both API and the Cloud Control Panel.</p>

<p>Our team has identified the root cause of the issue and a fix is currently in progress.</p>

<p>We will provide another update once the fix is confirmed.</p>
