            <h4> Update </h4>
            <p>Our Engineering team has confirmed that the fix implemented earlier was successful in mitigating the issue with connectivity in our SFO regions. Users should now be able to connect to their Droplet and Droplet-based services without any issues.</p>

<p>At this time, all services should now be operating normally. We will monitor this incident for a short period of time to confirm full resolution.</p>
