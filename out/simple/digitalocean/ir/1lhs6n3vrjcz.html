            <h4> Resolved </h4>
            <p>From 10:30 to 11:35 UTC, our Engineering team observed an issue with Container Registry and App Platform builds in the AMS3 and FRA1 regions.</p>

<p>During this time, users may have experienced delays while building their Apps and could have potentially experienced timeout errors in builds as a result. Additionally, a subset of customers may have experienced latency while interacting with the Container Registries.</p>

<p>Our Engineering team found that a backing component of the Container Registry was experiencing high memory usage. They were able to remediate that component at 11:35 UTC, which resolved the issue.</p>

<p>We apologize for the inconvenience. If you have any questions or continue to experience issues, please reach out via a Support ticket on your account.</p>
