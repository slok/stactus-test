            <h4> Investigating </h4>
            <p>Our Engineering team is investigating an uptick in error rates for users creating Spaces Buckets in multiple regions, starting May 3.</p>

<p>We have rolled back a recent change in our systems in an effort to address the issue. However, we are still investigating and users may still experience errors when attempting to create Spaces Buckets, both through the cloud control panel and via API.</p>

<p>We apologize for the inconvenience and will share an update once we have more information.</p>
