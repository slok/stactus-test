                <p>Our Engineering team identified and resolved an issue impacting multiple services, in multiple regions.</p>

<p>From 19:53 - 20:22 UTC, users may have experienced errors with the following operations, for all regions:
Droplet creates with a root password
Droplet root password resets
Droplet Snapshots
MongoDB cluster creates
Let’sEncrypt certificate creation (for Load Balancers and Spaces)
LoadBalancer creation with certificates
Spaces bucket and key creations
Fetching CSV invoices
Bulk actions in the Spaces UI</p>

<p>Additionally, users could have seen latency while creating and updating Apps.</p>

<p>Our Engineering team quickly identified the root cause of the incident to be an incorrect firewall policy applied to core infrastructure and rolled back the change.</p>
