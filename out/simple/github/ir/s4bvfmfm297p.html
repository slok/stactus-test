            <h4> Resolved </h4>
            <p>On July 31st, 2024, between 00:31 UTC and 03:37 UTC the Codespaces service was degraded and connecting through non-web flows such as VS Code or the GitHub CLI were unavailable. Using Codespaces via the web portal was not impacted. This was due to a code change resulting in authentication failures from the Codespaces public API.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by reverting the change upon discovering the cause of the issue.<br /><br />We are working to improve testing, monitoring, and rollout of new features to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.</p>
