            <h3> Resolved - Jul 19, 02:38 </h3>
            <p> <p>Beginning on July 18, 2024 at 22:38 UTC, network issues within an upstream provider led to degraded experiences across Actions, Copilot, and Pages services.<br /><br />Up to 50% of Actions workflow jobs were stuck in the queuing state, including Pages deployments.  Users were also not able to enable Actions or register self-hosted runners. This was caused by an unreachable backend resource in the Central US region. That resource is configured for geo-replication, but the replication configuration prevented resiliency when one region was unavailable. Updating the replication configuration mitigated the impact by allowing successful requests while one region was unavailable. By July 19 00:12 UTC, users saw some improvement in Actions jobs and full recovery of Pages. Standard hosted runners and self-hosted Actions workflows were healthy by 2:10 UTC and large hosted runners fully recovered at 2:38.<br /><br />Copilot requests were also impacted with up to 2% of Copilot Chat requests and 0.5% of Copilot Completions requests resulting in errors. Chat requests were routed to other regions after 20 minutes while Completions requests took 45 minutes to reroute. <br /><br />We have identified improvements to detection to reduce the time to engage all impacted on-call teams and improvements to our replication configuration and failover workflows to be more resilient to unhealthy dependencies and reduce our time to failover and mitigate customer impact.</p>
