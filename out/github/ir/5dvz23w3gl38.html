            <h3> Resolved - Jul  2, 19:24 </h3>
            <p> <p>On July 02, 2024, between 18:21 UTC and 19:24 UTC the code search service was degraded and returned elevated 500 HTTP status responses. On average, the error rate was 38% of code search requests. This was due to a bad deployment causing some user&rsquo;s rate limit calculations to error while processing code search requests. This impacted approximately 2,000 users.<br />We mitigated the incident by rolling back the bad deployment along with resetting rate limits for all users.<br />We have identified and implemented updates in the testing of rate limit calculations to prevent this problem from happening again, and clarified deployment processes for verification before a full production rollout to minimize impact in the future.</p>
