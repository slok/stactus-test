            <h3> Resolved - May  7, 15:55 </h3>
            <p> <p>Starting on May 7th, 2024 at 14:00 UTC, our elasticsearch cluster that powers Issues and Pull Requests became unresponsive correlating to a spike in usage.  This affected GitHub customers who were trying to search issues and pull requests.<br /><br />We mitigated this incident by adding additional cluster members which increased the resources available to the cluster.  We are working to add additional safeguards to our endpoints.  We are also continuing to investigate the root cause of the instability and if the index needs to be re-sharded for future risk mitigation.</p>
